You are going to write a program that will mark a spot on a map with an X.

In the starting code, you will find a variable called map.

This map contains a nested list. When map is printed this is what it looks like, notice the nesting:

[['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']]

This is a bit hard to work with. So on lines 6 and 23, we've used this line of code print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}") to format the 3 lists to be printed as a 3 by 3 grid, each on a new line.

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
Now it looks a bit more like the coordinates of a real map

line1 = ["⬜️","️⬜️","️⬜️"]
line2 = ["⬜️","⬜️","️⬜️"]
line3 = ["⬜️️","⬜️️","⬜️️"]
map = [line1, line2, line3]
print("Hiding your treasure! X marks the spot.")
position = input().upper() # Where do you want to put the treasure?
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆
# Write your code below this row 👇
letter = position[0].upper()  # get letter and uppercase it
abc = ['A', 'B', 'C']
letter_idx = abc.index(letter) # get index of letter based on previous list
number_idx = int(position[1])-1

map[number_idx][letter_idx] = 'X'

print(f"{line1}\n{line2}\n{line3}")
