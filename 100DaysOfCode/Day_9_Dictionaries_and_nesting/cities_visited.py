LESSON 23 DAY 9 - DICTIONARY IN LIST
You are going to write a program that adds to a travel_log. You can see a travel_log which is a List that contains 2 Dictionaries. Your job is to create a function that can add new countries to this list.

Write a function that will work with the following line of code on line 21 to add the entry for Brazil to the travel_log.

add_new_country("Brazil", 5, ["Sao Paulo", "Rio de Janeiro"])
DO NOT modify the travel_log directly. The goal is to create a function that modifies it.

Example Input
Brazil
5
["Sao Paulo", "Rio de Janeiro"]
Example Output
I've been to Brazil 5 times.
My favourite city was Sao Paulo.

    Adds a new country entry to the travel log data structure.
  
    Args:
        country (str): The name of the country.
        visits (int): The number of times the user has visited the country.
        list_of_cities (list): A list containing the names of cities visited in the country.
  
    Returns:
        None
  
    Appends a dictionary containing the provided information about the country to the `travel_log` variable, which is assumed to be a list. This dictionary uses the keys"country",    "visits", and "cities" to store the corresponding information.
