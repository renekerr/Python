"""
The Snake Game has been enhanced by incorporating the following functionalities:

    - Implementation of a random starting head direction (north, south, east, or west)
    - Tracking of the highest score achieved
    - Inclusion of snake size constants for effortless adjustment of the size and outline
    - Ability to exit the screen by pressing the 'Esc' key


NOTE: Make sure to reset highest_score.txt if needed

Using tracer(0) and update() together allows developers to achieve smoother animations, 
reduce rendering overhead, and maintain control over the timing and frequency of screen updates, 
ultimately leading to a more polished and efficient graphical experience in Turtle-based projects.
